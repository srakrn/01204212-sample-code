# 01204212 Sample Codes

These codes are sample codes written in C for the Abstract Data Type and Problem Solving subject.

Most of the codes are adapted from Preeda L.'s slides and materials used in the classroom. However, comments to the code are heavily added to increase clarity while examining the concepts of datatypes.

Codes are guranteed to be compilable by modern C compilers that accepts the `gnu89` standard (in other words, default GCC preference). Caveats are that some of the codes uses the modern C standards (for example declaring a loop variable inside the `for` syntax. Please compile carefully.
