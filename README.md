# 01204212 Sample Codes

These codes are sample codes written in C for the Abstract Data Type and Problem Solving subject.

Most of the codes are adapted from Preeda L.'s slides and materials used in the classroom. However, comments to the code are heavily added to increase clarity while examining the concepts of datatypes.

Even though this readme page is in English, Thai comments will be found in the code, as I intends this example coded to be read among Thai friends at the Computer Engineering Department.

Codes are guranteed to be compilable by modern C compilers that accepts the `gnu89` standard (in other words, default GCC preference). Caveats are that some of the codes uses the modern C standards (for example declaring a loop variable inside the `for` syntax. Please compile carefully. Also, the .exe files which maybe found is compiled on Linux (Ubuntu 17.06, x64 architecture), not the common Windows executable file
